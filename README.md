# Maple Machine

The **Maple Machine** (*MapMac*) is a virtual machine for educational purposes. The goal is to learn more about CPUs and
to enable interaction with I/O and the operation of a simple graphics unit. In the long term, the development of an
operating system should be enabled.
It is closely aligned with ARM assembly languages. This is a Von-Neumann machine.

**This project should include:**

- A compiler (Assembly â†’ Object files)
- Linker
- Assembler
- Interpreter

## Memory

The memory contains 64-bit values. This includes both program code and data values. The *Stack* shrinks in this context.
##### Controlled Access Region (CAR)

Memory access can be restricted through so-called CARs.

A command within a CAR can only access memory within the CAR or the Stack. A CAR can only be defined or removed outside
of a CAR.
The following commands can be used for this:

| Name                    | Command              | Purpose                                                                         | OpCode      |
|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| CAR Define              | `CARD ID START, END` | Defines a region in memory with an ID                                           | `1000 0000` |
| CAR Remove              | `CARR ID`            | Removes a region with a given ID                                                | `1000 0001` |
| CAR Stack Region Define | `CASD START END`     | Defines the Stack and its size. The Stack Pointer is not automatically changed. | `1000 0010` |

## Registers

We have several general-purpose registers `r0` to `r9`. These can be used for anything. `r0` is the default return
register.

| Register     | Definition                                                                                 | Numerical Value  |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `r0`         | Return Register                                                                            | `0000`           |
| `r1` to `r5` | General-Purpose Register                                                                   | `0001` to `0101` |
| `sp`         | Stack Pointer                                                                              | `0110`           |
| `pc`         | Program Counter                                                                            | `0111`           |
| `dl`         | Dynamic Link - This points to an instruction (usually used for return)                     | `1000`           |
| `cr`/`mr`    | Compare or Math Result: This register holds the flags set by comparison or math operations | `1001`           |
| `iop`        | IOPointer: Points to an IO device to communicate with                                      | `1010`           |
| `ps`         | Program Start - Points to the beginning of the program. Used for dynamic program loading   | `1011`           |
| `pl`         | Program Length - The length in words allocated for the program.                            | `1100`           |
| `fp`         | Frame Pointer - Points to the beginning of the usable memory area.                         | `1001`           |
| `h0` to `h1` | Hardware Register - These registers are reserved for specific hardware functions.          | `1110` to `1111` |

## Things to keep in mind
#### Floats

When performing float operations, the values must first be moved into registers.
The float operators do not support direct value inputs but must instead rely on the register values.

This is due to a limitation with floats, specifically that they need to fit into 32-bit.
